# NYC-Covid-Data
This is an academic project, using python to visualize Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths. We use a non-linear regression with options for Quadratic or Cubic Polynomial modeling. This is a limited version which can later be altered into subplots to best visualize all information at once. This is preferred since obvious connections can be drawn by simple visual comparison.  

CovidDataNYC.Py Features:
This allows you to go back as far as 90 days, or as short as 20 days.
The non-linear curve can be made a quadratic or cubic function.

CovidDataNYC_logscale.py Features:
Outputs logarithmic cases, hospitalizations, and deaths on one graph for easy comparison. 

CovidDataNYC_v2.Py Features:
Updated on 8/16/2021 to include subplots.
